    "# Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM) \n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.\n",

    "**SVM** works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data are transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.\n",

    "# SVM node\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM node enables you to use a support vector machine to classify data. SVM is particularly suited for use with wide datasets, that is, those with a large number of predictor fields. You can use the default settings on the node to produce a basic model relatively quickly, or you can use the Expert settings to experiment with different types of SVM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model has been built, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Browse the model nugget to display the relative importance of the input fields in building the model.\n",
    "- Append a Table node to the model nugget to view the model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A medical researcher has obtained a dataset containing characteristics of a number of human cell samples extracted from patients who were believed to be at risk of developing cancer. Analysis of the original data showed that many of the characteristics differed significantly between benign and malignant samples. The researcher wants to develop an SVM model that can use the values of similar cell characteristics in samples from other patients to give an early indication of whether their samples might be benign or malignant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SVM Node Model Options\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model name**. You can generate the model name automatically based on the target or ID field (or model type in cases where no such field is specified) or specify a custom name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use partitioned data**. If a partition field is defined, this option ensures that data from only the training partition is used to build the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Create split models**. Builds a separate model for each possible value of input fields that are specified as split fields. See Building Split Models for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## SVM Node Expert Options\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have detailed knowledge of support vector machines, expert options allow you to fine-tune the training process. To access the expert options, set Mode to **Expert** on the Expert tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Append all probabilities (valid only for categorical targets)**. If selected (checked), specifies that probabilities for each possible value of a nominal or flag target field are displayed for each record processed by the node. If this option is not selected, the probability of only the predicted value is displayed for nominal or flag target fields. The setting of this check box determines the default state of the corresponding check box on the model nugget display.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stopping criteria**. Determines when to stop the optimization algorithm. Values range from 1.0E–1 to 1.0E–6; default is 1.0E–3. Reducing the value results in a more accurate model, but the model will take longer to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization parameter (C)** . Controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the training error term. Value should normally be between 1 and 10 inclusive; default is 10. Increasing the value improves the classification accuracy (or reduces the regression error) for the training data, but this can also lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression precision (epsilon)**. Used only if the measurement level of the target field is Continuous. Causes errors to be accepted provided that they are less than the value specified here. Increasing the value may result in faster modeling, but at the expense of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kernel type**. Determines the type of kernel function used for the transformation. Different kernel types cause the separator to be calculated in different ways, so it is advisable to experiment with the various options. Default is **RBF** (Radial Basis Function).\n",
    "\n",
    "**RBF gamma**. Enabled only if the kernel type is set to **RBF**. Value should normally be between 3/k and 6/k, where k is the number of input fields. For example, if there are 12 input fields, values between 0.25 and 0.5 would be worth trying. Increasing the value improves the classification accuracy (or reduces the regression error) for the training data, but this can also lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gamma**. Enabled only if the kernel type is set to **Polynomial or Sigmoid**. Increasing the value improves the classification accuracy (or reduces the regression error) for the training data, but this can also lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias**. Enabled only if the kernel type is set to **Polynomial or Sigmoid**. Sets the coef0 value in the kernel function. The default value 0 is suitable in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Degree**. Enabled only if Kernel type is set to **Polynomial**. Controls the complexity (dimension) of the mapping space. Normally you would not use a value greater than 10.\n",
